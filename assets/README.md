# Assets Directory

This directory is for game assets like sprites, tilesets, and sounds.

Currently, the game uses procedurally generated colored rectangles for all visuals.

## Future Additions

- `sprites/`: Character and enemy sprites
- `tilesets/`: Dungeon tile graphics
- `sounds/`: Sound effects and music

Feel free to add custom assets and reference them in the code!
